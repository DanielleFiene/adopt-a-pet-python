# Flask Pet Adoption Application

This is a Flask-based web application that demonstrates a simple pet adoption website. The application showcases your ability to work with the Flask framework, route handling, dynamic content generation, and integrating a helper module for managing data.

## Features

### 1. **Homepage**
- The homepage displays an introductory message about pet adoption.
- Provides links to browse different types of pets available for adoption (Dogs, Cats, Rabbits).

### 2. **Pet Categories**
- Dynamically generated pages for each type of pet (e.g., Dogs, Cats, Rabbits).
- Lists all available pets of the selected type with links to individual profiles.
- Includes error handling for invalid pet types.

### 3. **Pet Profiles**
- Detailed profile pages for each pet, including:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Breed
  - Description
  - Image (via URL)
- Includes error handling for invalid pet IDs.

## What This Project Demonstrates

### Flask Framework
- Setting up a Flask application.
- Defining and organizing routes using the `@app.route` decorator.

### Dynamic Content Generation
- Generating HTML dynamically based on user input and data.
- Using URL parameters to handle specific content (e.g., `/animals/<pet_type>/<int:pet_id>`).

### Data Integration
- Leveraging a `helper` module (`pets`) to manage application data.
- Iterating through data structures to create dynamic lists and detailed pages.

### Error Handling
- Providing fallback content when invalid pet types or IDs are accessed.

### HTML Structure
- Utilizing HTML to structure content, including lists, links, and images.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python installed on your system.
   - Flask installed (`pip install flask`).
   - The `helper` module (`pets`) should be available in the same directory as `app.py`.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the application using:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - The application will start in debug mode and can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Explore the Application**:
   - Visit the homepage to browse pet categories.
   - Click on a category to view available pets.
   - Select a pet to view its detailed profile.

## Example Data Structure (`helper.pets`)

The `pets` dictionary might look like this:

```python
pets = {
    "dogs": [
        {"name": "Buddy", "age": 3, "breed": "Golden Retriever", "description": "Friendly and energetic.", "url": "https://example.com/buddy.jpg"},
        ...
    ],
    "cats": [
        {"name": "Mittens", "age": 2, "breed": "Tabby", "description": "Loves to cuddle.", "url": "https://example.com/mittens.jpg"},
        ...
    ],
    "rabbits": [
        {"name": "Thumper", "age": 1, "breed": "Mini Lop", "description": "Playful and curious.", "url": "https://example.com/thumper.jpg"},
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Backend Development**: Creating a dynamic web application using Python and Flask.
- **Routing**: Building a hierarchical URL structure for a better user experience.
- **Data Handling**: Using Python data structures to dynamically generate content.
- **Error Management**: Designing user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the `pets` dictionary in the `helper` module to add more pets or categories. You can also style the HTML output using CSS to enhance the visual appeal of the application.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding a database for storing pet information.
- Incorporating a search or filter feature for pets.
- Enabling user submissions to add pets for adoption.
